# Quine-McCluskey Algorithm

The Quine-McCluskey algorithm, also known as the method of prime implicants, is a technique used to minimize Boolean functions.

## Sum of Products

The input consists of **minterms** and **don't cares**, and the output is the results displayed in the form of Sum of Products.

## Product of Sums

The input consists of **maxterms** and **don't cares**, and the output is the results displayed in the form of Product of Sums.
